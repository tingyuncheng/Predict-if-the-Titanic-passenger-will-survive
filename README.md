# Project_1_Titanic

This was my first Python project, using Python to build a predictive model.

Subject: 
Kaggle - Titanic (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

Goal: 
To predict if the passenger will survive. 
As my goal was clear, this was supervised learning. 
I used the data we knew to build two models, Logistics Regression model and Decision Tree, apply the models to the validation dataset, and score the record to make the best guess/prediction.

For this project:
I am predicting a binary, categorical target(outcome) variable.
Each row is a record/case (here means a passenger record).
Each column is a variable/feature.

Main packages I used:
- pandas
- matplotlib.pyplot
- numpy
- sklearn
- yellowbrick

I refer to some resources and course materials and I appreciate them helping me grow.
